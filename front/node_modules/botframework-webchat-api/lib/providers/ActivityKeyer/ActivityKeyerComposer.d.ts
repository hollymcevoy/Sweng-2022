/**
 * React context composer component to assign a perma-key to every activity.
 * This will support both `useGetActivityByKey` and `useGetKeyByActivity` custom hooks.
 *
 * Today, `activity.id` is only guaranteed for activity from others.
 * Not all activities sent by the local user has `activity.id`.
 *
 * To track outgoing activities, we added `activity.channelData.clientActivityId`.
 *
 * This component will create a local key, which can be used to track both
 * incoming and outgoing activities in a consistent way.
 *
 * Local key are only persisted in memory. On refresh, they will be a new random key.
